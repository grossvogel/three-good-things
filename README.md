# Three Good Things

Writing down three good things each day can make you happier.
This simple app will remind you to record your three things every
day and store them for future reference. On devices running
Google Chrome, you can also receive a daily push notification
to remind you if you haven't yet entered your three things.


### TODO

* Get notifications working in Firefox
* Add helmet for security headers?
* Client-side error message for empty Good Thing title
* Image upload w/ device camera support
* View history of good things in a long summary list
* Use browserHistory instead of hashHistory for nicer URLs
* Server-side rendering
